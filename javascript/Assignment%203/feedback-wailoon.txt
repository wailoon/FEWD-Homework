When the user changes the input of the drop-down, update the background image based on what they selected

Use $.append() in your iteration on the drop-down menu
  - Good!
Use the $.attr() function to update html classes
  - Good!
Get the value of user input using $.val()

Additional Comments:

Everything is working. Your array and for loop look good. Well done!

One little thing (and this is more of a stylistic thing), I would probably not include line 20:
  $("#city-type").val("");
For text boxes, it's nice to erase the previous text, but with dropdowns, usually the text would stay. But that's really minor, and I know you were focusing on the top part.

And also, nice job setting up the array and for loop for the hamburger menu during class yesterday. You're getting the hang of this stuff!
