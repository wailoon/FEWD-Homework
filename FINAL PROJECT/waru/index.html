							<h4>Rat</h4>
								<p>People born in a year of the Rooster are very observant. Hardworking, resourceful, courageous and talented, Roosters are very confident about themselves. Roosters are always active, amusing and popular among the crowd. Roosters are talkative, outspoken, frank, open, honest, and loyal individuals. They like to be the center of attention and always appear attractive and beautiful.</p>

								<p>Roosters are happiest when they are surrounded by others, whether at a party or just a social gathering. They enjoy the spotlight and will exhibit their charm at any occasion.</p>

								<p>Roosters expect others to listen to them while they speak, and can become agitated if others don't. Vain and boastful, Roosters like to brag about themselves and their accomplishments. Their continually seeking the unwavering attention of others annoys people around them at times.</p>

								<p>Rats are most compatible with <a href="#ox">Ox</a> and <a href="#snake">Snake</a>.</p>
